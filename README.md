## Akumo Platform

We can define the Akumo Platform, briefly as a technology to develop in a simple and powerful way Cross-platform Script.
<p>
With Akumo we can develop scripts of general propose that can running in distincts operating systems without any changing on the code. 
</p>
Usually in one environment we found several scripts written in different languages to accomplish distincts goals. For instance we can have scripts written using bash to move and copy file and to handle http set up, scripts written in python to monitoring directories and start jenkins pipeline and so on so forth. Furthmore in such environment there is different Operation Systems.
<p>
Using Akumo Platform in this scenario we'll should has all that scripts written using the same sintaxe/language and running everywhere (Windows, Mac, Linux). Thus saving either development and maintenance time.
</p>
### API

The entire platform was developed with simplicity in mind. Akumo's offering offers a simple and powerful way to develop cross-platform scripts to make proposed distinctions. To achieve these goals, we make use of a powerful API (pre-built functions). To support this API, there is a robust technological platform. Furthmore this API could be easily extend. 
<p>
So we can summed up the keys of the Akumo Platform as:
</p>
1. Simplicity
2. Reusability
3. Extensibility
