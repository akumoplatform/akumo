# Akumo Platform

Akumo Platform is a technology to develop in a <b>simple</b> and <b>powerful</b> way <b>Cross-platform Scripting.</b>
<p>
With Akumo we can develop scripts of general use that can running in distinct operating systems without any changing on the code. 
</p>

## Use

Usually in one environment we found several scripts written in different languages to accomplish distincts goals. For instance we can have scripts written using bash to move and copy file and to handle http set up, scripts written in python to monitoring directories and start jenkins pipeline and so on so forth. Furthermore in such environment there is different Operation Systems.
<p>
Using <b>Akumo Platform</b> in this scenario we'll should has all that scripts written using the <b>same syntax/language</b> and <b>running everywhere</b> (Windows, Mac, Linux). Moreover Akumo has a simple and easy to coding syntax. With Akumo you'll save either development and maintenance time.
</p>

## API

Akumo's offers a simple and powerful way to develop cross-platform scripts to general use. To achieve these goals, we make use of a <b>powerful API</b> (pre-built functions). To support this API, there is a <b>robust technological platform</b>. Furthermore this API could be easily extend. 
<p>
So we can summed up the keys of the Akumo Platform as:
</p>

1. Simplicity<br>
2. Reusability<br>
3. Extensibility<br>

## Extensibility

Extend Core API improving it, is easier than you could guess. To know how extend works see the <a href='https://github.com/akumoplatform/akumo/wiki/C.-Features'>features</a> topic on wiki <i>( basically put extensions files on /ext directory)</i>. But for the impacient grasp how easy it is, you could see either <a href='https://github.com/akumoplatform/akumo-js'>JS extensions repository</a> and <a href='https://github.com/akumoplatform/akumo-commons'>Java extensions repository</a>, each one of these extensions has a small documentation with examples.
