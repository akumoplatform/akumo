# Akumo Platform

Akumo Platform is a technology to develop in a <b>simple</b> and <b>powerful</b> way <b>Cross-platform Scripting.</b>
<p>
With Akumo we can develop scripts of general use that can running in distinct operating systems without any changing on the code. 
</p>

## Use

Usually in one environment we found several scripts written in different languages to accomplish distincts goals. For instance we can have scripts written using bash to move and copy file and to handle http set up, scripts written in python to monitoring directories and start jenkins pipeline and so on so forth. Furthmore in such environment there is different Operation Systems.
<p>
Using <b>Akumo Platform</b> in this scenario we'll should has all that scripts written using the <b>same sintaxe/language</b> and <b>running everywhere</b> (Windows, Mac, Linux). Moreover Akumo has a simple and easy to coding syntax. With Akumo you'll save either development and maintenance time.
</p>

## API

Akumo's offers a simple and powerful way to develop cross-platform scripts to general use. To achieve these goals, we make use of a <b>powerful API</b> (pre-built functions). To support this API, there is a <b>robust technological platform</b>. Furthmore this API could be easily extend. 
<p>
So we can summed up the keys of the Akumo Platform as:
</p>

1. Simplicity<br>
2. Reusability<br>
3. Extensibility<br>
